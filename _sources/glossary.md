## Glossary of Logical Terms

### Proposition
A **proposition** is a declarative statement that is either *true* or *false*, but not both. It represents the content of a statement regardless of its linguistic form.

**Examples:**
- "The Earth orbits the Sun" is a proposition because it can be evaluated as true.
- "The Moon is made of cheese." (False)
- "2 + 2 = 4" (True)

---

### Predicate
A **predicate** is a function or property that returns a truth value when applied to one or more subjects. In logic, it expresses something about an object or variable, often written as \( P(x) \).

**Examples:**
- In "Socrates is mortal", "is mortal" is the predicate and "Socrates" is the subject. In predicate logic: \( \text{Mortal}(x) \)
- \( \text{IsTall}(x) \): "x is tall"
- \( \text{Loves}(x, y) \): "x loves y"
- \( \text{Prime}(n) \): "n is a prime number"

### Premise
A **premise** is a proposition that provides support or reasons for a conclusion in an argument. Premises are the starting points of reasoning.

**Examples:**
- "All mammals are warm-blooded."
- "If it rains, the ground gets wet."
- "Jane is taller than Tom."

### Argument
An **argument** is a group of propositions in which some (premises) are intended to support another (conclusion). It's the fundamental structure of reasoning.

**Examples:**
1.  
   - Premise: All birds have feathers.  
   - Premise: A sparrow is a bird.  
   - Conclusion: Therefore, a sparrow has feathers.

2.  
   - Premise: If you study, you will pass.  
   - Premise: You studied.  
   - Conclusion: Therefore, you will pass.

---

### Conclusion
A **conclusion** is the proposition that is supported or proven by the premises in an argument.

**Examples:**
- "Therefore, the Earth is round." (based on previous evidence/premises)
- "Hence, she must be at home."
- "It follows that all bachelors are unmarried."

---

### Inference (Reasoning)
**Inference**, or **reasoning**, is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises or known facts.

**Examples:**
- From "All dogs bark" and "Rex is a dog," we infer "Rex barks."
- From "If the light is red, stop" and "The light is red," infer "Stop."
- From "All metals conduct electricity" and "Copper is a metal," infer "Copper conducts electricity."

### Validity (Valid)
An argument is **valid** if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Validity is about form, not the actual truth of the statements.

**Examples:**
1.  
   - Premise: All cats are animals.  
   - Premise: Felix is a cat.  
   - Conclusion: Felix is an animal. ‚úÖ Valid

2.  
   - Premise: All unicorns are reptiles.  
   - Premise: Bob is a unicorn.  
   - Conclusion: Bob is a reptile. ‚úÖ Valid (though premises are false)

3.  
   - Premise: Some dogs are brown.  
   - Premise: Rex is brown.  
   - Conclusion: Rex is a dog. ‚ùå Invalid (conclusion doesn't logically follow)

---

### Axiom
An **axiom** is a self-evident or universally accepted principle that doesn't require proof, used as a starting point in reasoning or mathematical systems.

**Examples:**
- In arithmetic: "For every number \( x \), \( x = x \)" (identity)
- In geometry: "Through any two distinct points, there is exactly one line."
- In set theory: "A set is determined by its elements."
