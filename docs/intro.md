## ⏰ Late Policy:  
**If problems arise with graded assignments, see your instructor in advance**

- The cutoff for **on-time submission is 08:00 🕖 a.m.** on the due date. 
- Late days are counted in 24-hour periods. Submitting between 08:00:01 on the due date and 08:00:00 the next day is one day late, and so on.
- You are given **5 grace days (self-granted extensions)** which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty. No more than **2 grace days** can used for each assignment.
- Instructor-granted extensions are only considered after all grace days are used and only given in exceptional situations. Computer problems such as hard-drive reimaging are **not** considered as exceptional situations and you must use grace days.
- Late work handed in when you have run out of grace is 💥 **discounted 25% for the first day late and 10% per day late thereafter**.
- Every assignment has a hard deadline; **4 days** past the original due date. 
- Late submissions (penalty or not) are not accepted after the hard deadline or after the solution to the assignment is published. No late submissions (penalty or not) will be accepted for the assignments right before GRs.

## 📄 Documentation Requirements

- All help received on work submitted for grading must be documented in accordance with the course documentation policy. 
- Each documentation statement must be specific enough that it explicitly describes what assistance was provided, how it was used in completing the assignment, and who provided the assistance.
- If no help was received on this assignment, the documentation statement must state “None.”
- If you checked answers with anyone, you must document with whom on which problems. You must document whether you made any changes or not.  If you did make changes, you must document the problems you changed and the reasons why.
- Vague documentation statements will result in a 5% deduction on the assignment.
